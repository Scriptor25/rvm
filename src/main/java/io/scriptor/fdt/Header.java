/**
 * The layout of the header for the devicetree is defined by the following C structure. All the header fields are
 * 32-bit integers, stored in big-endian format.
 *
 * @param magic             This field shall contain the value 0xd00dfeed (big-endian).
 * @param totalsize         This field shall contain the total size in bytes of the devicetree data structure.
 *                          This size shall encompass all sections of the structure: the header, the memory reservation
 *                          block, structure block and strings block, as well as any free space gaps between the blocks
 *                          or after the final block.
 * @param off_dt_struct     This field shall contain the offset in bytes of the structure block from the beginning of
 *                          the header.
 * @param off_dt_strings    This field shall contain the offset in bytes of the strings block from the beginning of the
 *                          header.
 * @param off_mem_rsvmap    This field shall contain the offset in bytes of the memory reservation block from the
 *                          beginning of the header.
 * @param version           This field shall contain the version of the devicetree data structure. The version is 17 if
 *                          using the structure as defined in this document. An DTSpec boot program may provide the
 *                          devicetree of a later version, in which case this field shall contain the version number
 *                          defined in whichever later document gives the details of that version.
 * @param last_comp_version This field shall contain the lowest version of the devicetree data structure with which the
 *                          version used is backwards compatible. So, for the structure as defined in this document
 *                          (version 17), this field shall contain 16 because version 17 is backwards compatible with
 *                          version 16, but not earlier versions. As per Section 5.1, a DTSpec boot program should
 *                          provide a devicetree in a format which is backwards compatible with version 16, and thus
 *                          this field shall always contain 16.
 * @param boot_cpuid_phys   This field shall contain the physical ID of the systemâ€™s boot CPU. It shall be identical to
 *                          the physical ID given in the reg property of that CPU node within the devicetree.
 * @param size_dt_strings   This field shall contain the length in bytes of the strings block section of the devicetree
 *                          blob.
 * @param size_dt_struct    This field shall contain the length in bytes of the structure block section of the
 *                          devicetree blob.
